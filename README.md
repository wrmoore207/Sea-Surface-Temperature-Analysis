# A Century of Ocean Temperature Trends (1905â€“2019)

This project explores changes in sea surface temperatures (SST) over more than a century, using data collected from 1905 to 2019. The analysis highlights long-term trends, seasonal variations, and anomalies in ocean temperatures, providing insights into climatic patterns and potential external influences.

## Goals
- Analyze long-term trends in average sea surface temperatures.
- Visualize seasonal patterns and inter-annual variability.
- Identify and highlight temperature anomalies.
- Detect patterns in anomalies and their potential links to external climatic factors.

## Key Visualizations

1. **Long-Term Trends**  
   A line plot illustrating the yearly average sea surface temperatures from 1905 to 2019, showing how temperatures have evolved over time.

## Future Work
- Incorporate external datasets to correlate anomalies with climate cycles (e.g., ENSO).
- Explore the impact of gaps in the data and refine methods to handle missing periods.
